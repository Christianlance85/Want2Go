We chose to create a website that would help people find events nearby to attend. 
Allows users to choose events nationwide.
Choose by event or city. Also the user can book hotel rooms through a link on our site. Uzsers can also use the Google Maps link to find various restaurants. This site provides what you need for an amazing night out or for a nice weekend getaway.
